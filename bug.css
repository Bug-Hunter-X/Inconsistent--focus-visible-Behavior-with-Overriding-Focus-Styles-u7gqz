The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to unexpected behavior with the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class:

```css
.my-element:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
```

This seems straightforward, but it can lead to inconsistencies if the element's default focus behavior is altered by other CSS or JavaScript.  For instance, if `outline: none` is applied elsewhere,  ` :focus-visible` might not function as expected, or its effect may be subtle and difficult to debug.
