Several approaches can solve or mitigate this problem.  The most direct involves ensuring that the `:focus-visible` rule has sufficient specificity to override conflicting styles:

```css
.my-element {
  outline: none; /* Prevents default outline */
}

.my-element:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue !important; /* Higher specificity to ensure override */
}
```

Alternatively, using a more robust focus management technique might be necessary, potentially involving JavaScript to manage the focus styles programmatically for better control and cross-browser consistency.
