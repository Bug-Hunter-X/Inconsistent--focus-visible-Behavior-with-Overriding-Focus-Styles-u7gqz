# Inconsistent :focus-visible Behavior with Overriding Focus Styles

This repository demonstrates a subtle but problematic issue related to the CSS `:focus-visible` pseudo-class.  The problem arises when the default focus styling of an element is altered (e.g., by setting `outline: none;`), causing the `:focus-visible` styles to behave inconsistently or unexpectedly.

The bug is detailed in `bug.css` and a potential solution (requiring additional specificity or alternative focus management techniques) is given in `bugSolution.css`.
